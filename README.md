# Superstore Sales Analysis | Power BI & SQL
## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end Superstore Sales Analysis using SQL for data preparation and Power BI for visualization.
The objective is to analyze sales performance, product profitability, and customer behavior to support data-driven business decisions.

The analysis is divided into three dashboards:

- Overview
- Product Analysis
- Customer Analysis

## Objectives

- Understand overall sales and order trends over time

- Identify top and bottom-performing products and categories

- Analyze regional and segment-wise sales contribution

- Distinguish between new, repeat, and one-time customers

- Provide actionable insights for business and sales strategy

 ## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL :** Data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and validation

- **Power BI :** Data modeling, DAX measures, interactive dashboards

- **Excel :** Initial data inspection and validation

 ## Dataset

- **Source :** [Kaggle/Superstore Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting)

## Key Insights

- From 2015 to 2018, total sales amounted to $2.26M, recording a 46.9% year-over-year growth, indicating strong overall business expansion.

- During the same period, the business processed 9,800 orders, with a 49.8% YoY increase, reflecting rising customer demand and order volume.

- The dataset includes 793 unique customers, of which 780 are repeat customers (2+ orders), leaving only 13 one-time customers, highlighting strong customer retention.

- The Consumer segment is the largest revenue contributor with $1.15M in sales, while the Home Office segment contributes the least at $0.42M.

- The West region contributes the highest share of sales, driven primarily by Washington and Texas, whereas the Central region, led by Illinois, shows the lowest contribution.

- At the product level, Phones (Technology) and Chairs (Furniture) are the top-performing sub-categories, generating approximately $0.33M and $0.32M in sales respectively. In contrast, Fasteners (Office Supplies) contribute the lowest sales at around $3K.

- Sales contribution across all major categories is relatively balanced, with Technology contributing slightly more and Office Supplies slightly less compared to other categories.

- Standard Class shipping is the most preferred mode, accounting for 59% of orders, indicating customers prioritize cost over delivery urgency, while Same Day shipping represents only 5.54% of total orders.

- Sean Miller, Tamara Chand, and Raymond Buch are the top three customers by total sales, whereas Roland Schwarz, Ken Brennan, and Jas O’Carroll rank lowest, primarily due to being one-time purchasers.
